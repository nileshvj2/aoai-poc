### Guide to Starting a Gen AI Project: RAG Application

This guide outlines the steps to start a Gen AI project, specifically a RAG application, using Azure as the cloud provider. These steps can be adapted for other platforms.

Steps:

* Request Access to Azure Open AI: Request Access (24-48 hours) -   https://aka.ms/oai/access  
* Create AI Project and Deploy Gen AI Model: Get Started (Pay-as-you-go plan) [Reference link]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/quickstarts/get-started-playground )
* Explore Chat Interface: Experiment without using your data.
* Learn Model Grounding Techniques.
* Finalize Use Case.


POC : (Low code)
* Understand RAG Approach.  Refer [Gen AI for begineers](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) course with examples.
* Prepare Data Source: Use samples/limited data for POC.
* Build Chat Web App: Deploy Chat Web App using Azure AI Studio. [Deploy chat App Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app)
* Learn Prompt Engineering Techniques (Refer prompt_engg_examples.ipynb)
* Experiment with Models, Prompts, and Parameters.

Pilot : (Pro code)
* Implement Basic RAG: Use your own app
* Compare, Evaluate, Reiterate.
* Test and Deploy Pilot Phase 1.


Pilot - (advanced): 
* Understand Advanced RAG Concepts.
* Experiment with Advanced RAG Designs.
* Compare, Evaluate, Reiterate.
* Test Model Response and Performance.
* Finalize Design and Architecture.
* Deploy Pilot Phase 2
* Monitor usage, performance and cost

Project: 
* Enhance Data source
* Build e2e pipeline 
* Design and Implement App architecture - load balancing/PTU/App gateways etc.
* Compare - Evaluate - reiterate 
* Deploy Project
* Monitor usage, performance and cost. 
* Compare - Evaluate - reiterate
