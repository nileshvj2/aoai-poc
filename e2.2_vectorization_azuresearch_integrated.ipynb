We are excited to offer our employees two comprehensive health \\ninsurance plans through Northwind Health. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus \\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive plan that provides comprehensive coverage for medical, \\nvision, and dental services. This plan also offers prescription drug coverage, mental health and substance \\nabuse coverage, and coverage for preventive care services. With Northwind Health Plus, you can choose \\nfrom a variety of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and \\npharmacies. This plan also offers coverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.\\n\\nNorthwind Standard \\nNorthwind Standard is a basic plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. This \\nplan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription drug coverage. With \\nNorthwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network providers, including primary care \\nphysicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This plan does not offer coverage for emergency \\nservices, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services.\\n\\nComparison of Plans \\nBoth plans offer coverage for routine physicals, well-child visits, immunizations, and other preventive \\ncare services. The plans also cover preventive care services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and \\nother cancer screenings. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus offers more comprehensive coverage than Northwind Standard. This plan offers \\ncoverage for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network, as well as mental health and \\nsubstance abuse coverage. Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental \\nhealth and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services. \\n\\nBoth plans offer coverage for prescription drugs. Northwind Health Plus offers a wider range of \\nprescription drug coverage than Northwind Standard. Northwind Health Plus covers generic, brand-\\nname, and specialty drugs, while Northwind Standard only covers generic and brand-name drugs. \\n\\nBoth plans offer coverage for vision and dental services. Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for vision \\nexams, glasses, and contact lenses, as well as dental exams, cleanings, and fillings. Northwind Standard \\nonly offers coverage for vision exams and glasses. \\n\\nBoth plans offer coverage for medical services. Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for hospital stays, \\ndoctor visits, lab tests, and X-rays. Northwind Standard only offers coverage for doctor visits and lab \\ntests. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus is a comprehensive plan that offers more coverage than Northwind Standard. \\nNorthwind Health Plus offers coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse \\ncoverage, and out-of-network services, while Northwind Standard does not. Northwind Health Plus also \\n\\n\\n\\noffers a wider range of prescription drug coverage than Northwind Standard. Both plans offer coverage \\nfor vision and dental services, as well as medical services.  \\n\\nCost Comparison\\nContoso Electronics deducts the employee's portion of the healthcare cost from each paycheck. This \\nmeans that the cost of the health insurance will be spread out over the course of the year, rather \\nthan being paid in one lump sum. The employee's portion of the cost will be calculated based on the \\nselected health plan and the number of people covered by the insurance. The table below shows a \\ncost comparison between the different health plans offered by Contoso Electronics:\\n\\nNext Steps \\nWe hope that this information has been helpful in understanding the differences between Northwind \\nHealth Plus and Northwind Standard. We are confident that you will find the right plan for you and \\nyour family.

       "    'chunk': \"Contractors \\n\\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN \\n\\nHealthcare Providers - Independent Contractors \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Northwind Standard plan includes independent contractors in its network of \\n\\nhealthcare providers. These independent contractors provide services that are covered \\n\\nunder the plan, such as primary care physician visits, specialty care services, and other \\n\\nhealthcare services. Depending on the plan, these independent contractors may also \\n\\nprovide services such as mental health and substance abuse counseling, physical therapy, \\n\\nand home health services.  \\n\\nIt is important for employees to understand that Northwind Standard does not provide \\n\\ncoverage for care received from independent contractors. Employees must pay for these \\n\\nservices out-of-pocket, and any claims for services provided by independent contractors \\n\\nmust be submitted directly to the provider.  \\n\\nWhen seeking care from an independent contractor, it is important for employees to make \\n\\nsure they are aware of any additional fees or restrictions that may apply. For example, some \\n\\nproviders may require a fee for services such as mental health counseling, or may only \\n\\naccept certain types of insurance. It is also important for employees to understand that the \\n\\nprovider may not be able to provide care if the employee does not have the required \\n\\ndocumentation or is unable to pay the required fee.  \\n\\nIn addition, it is important for employees to understand that independent contractors may \\n\\nnot be subject to the same regulations as other healthcare providers. For example, the \\n\\nprovider may not be required to adhere to the same quality standards as other healthcare \\n\\nproviders, and may not be required to be licensed in the state where the services are \\n\\nprovided.  \\n\\nWhen selecting a provider, it is important for employees to make sure they are familiar with \\n\\nthe provider’s policies and procedures. Employees should also make sure they understand \\n\\nany additional costs that may be associated with the services provided by the independent \\n\\ncontractor.  \\n\\nFinally, when selecting a provider, it is important for employees to research the provider’s \\n\\nbackground and credentials. Employees should make sure the provider is properly licensed \\n\\nand certified, and has a good reputation in the healthcare community. Additionally, \\n\\nemployees should make sure the provider is up-to-date on the latest advances in healthcare \\n\\ntechnology and treatments, so they can be sure they are receiving the best possible care.  \\n\\nOverall, when selecting a healthcare provider, it is important for employees to do their \\n\\nresearch and make sure they understand the provider’s policies and procedures, as well as \\n\\nany additional costs that may be associated with the services they provide. Additionally, it is \\n\\nimportant for employees to make sure the provider is properly licensed and certified, and \\n\\nhas a good reputation in the healthcare community. By doing their research and \\n\\nunderstanding the provider’s qualifications and policies, employees can be sure they are \\n\\nreceiving the best possible care. \\n\\nIntentionally False Or Misleading Statements \\n\\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN  \\n\\n\\n\\nIntentionally False Or Misleading Statements:  \\n\\nWhen it comes to health insurance, there are unfortunately many companies who make \\n\\nintentionally false or misleading statements about their plans. Northwind Health is no \\n\\nexception. It is important for employees to be aware of any potential inaccuracies or false \\n\\ninformation that Northwind Health may use when discussing their plans. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that Northwind Standard does not offer \\n\\ncoverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-\\n\\nnetwork services. The Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for medical, vision, and \\n\\ndental services, but does not cover any of the services mentioned. While Northwind Health \\n\\nmay advertise that their plan covers these services, it is important to be aware that they do \\n\\nnot. \\n\\nNorthwind Health may also make claims that their plan covers any type of preventive care \\n\\nservices. While Northwind Standard does cover some preventive care services, it is \\n\\nimportant to remember that they may not cover all preventive care services. It is important \\n\\nto read the plan details in order to determine which preventive care services are covered. \\n\\nIt is also important to be aware that Northwind Health may make claims that their network \\n\\nof in-network providers is comprehensive. While Northwind Standard does offer a variety \\n\\nof in-network providers, it is important to remember that the network of in-network \\n\\nproviders may not be as comprehensive as Northwind Health claims. It is important to \\n\\nresearch the providers and services offered in the Northwind Standard plan in order to \\n\\ndetermine if the providers and services offered are sufficient for the employee's needs.\"},\n",

It also covers mental health services and support for \\n\\nfamily members of those with SUD.  \\n\\nExceptions  \\n\\nNot all services related to SUD are covered by the Northwind Health Plus plan. For example, \\n\\nthe plan does not cover experimental treatments or services that are not medically \\n\\nnecessary. It also does not cover services provided by non-network providers.  \\n\\nTips for Employees  \\n\\nIf you or someone you care about is struggling with SUD, there are a few things you can do \\n\\nto get the most out of your Northwind Health Plus plan:  \\n\\n• Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional about your symptoms and the \\n\\ntreatments that may be available.  \\n\\n• Make sure you understand the coverage provided by your plan and that you receive all the \\n\\nservices that are covered.  \\n\\n• Be aware of the out-of-pocket costs associated with the services you receive.  \\n\\n• Take advantage of any support services offered by the plan, such as counseling, group \\n\\ntherapy, or family support.  \\n\\n\\n\\n• Ask your doctor or mental health provider about medications that may be covered by your \\n\\nplan.  \\n\\n• Reach out to family and friends for support.  \\n\\n• Take steps to reduce stress in your life and find healthy ways to cope with difficult \\n\\nemotions.  \\n\\nAt Contoso, we want to make sure our employees have the resources they need to take care \\n\\nof their mental and physical health.

With Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus, you have access to comprehensive coverage for a variety of surgeries, including \\n\\ninpatient and outpatient procedures. However, there are some exceptions to this coverage.  \\n\\nThe first exception is that Northwind Health Plus does not cover cosmetic surgery.

This includes procedures \\n\\nsuch as breast augmentation, liposuction, and nose reshaping.  \\n\\nThe second exception is that Northwind Health Plus does not cover experimental \\n\\nprocedures or treatments.

We encourage you to take \\n\\nadvantage of the mental health coverage provided by Northwind Health Plus. \\n\\nNeurodevelopmental Therapy (Habilitation) \\n\\nNeurodevelopmental Therapy (Habilitation) \\n\\nNeurodevelopmental therapy (habilitation) is a type of service offered under the Northwind \\n\\nHealth Plus plan that is designed to help individuals with physical, mental, and/or \\n\\ndevelopmental disabilities. Habilitation services focus on helping individuals develop, \\n\\nmaintain, and improve skills and functioning in areas like communication, self-care, \\n\\nmobility, and social skills.  \\n\\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, habilitation services are covered up to a certain \\n\\ndollar amount and number of visits. This amount and the number of visits may vary \\n\\ndepending on the individual’s needs. To receive coverage for habilitation services, the \\n\\nindividual must be referred to a qualified provider by their primary care physician.  \\n\\nWhen seeking habilitation services, it is important to consider the individual’s needs and \\n\\ngoals. The provider should take this into consideration when creating a treatment plan. \\n\\nSome of the goals of habilitation services may include improving the individual’s ability to \\n\\ncommunicate, learning how to use adaptive equipment, improving physical coordination \\n\\nand strength, and developing social and behavioral skills.  \\n\\nWhen seeking habilitation services, it is important to understand the different types of \\n\\ntherapy that are available.

It is important to understand which type of therapy is best \\n\\nsuited for the individual’s needs and goals.  \\n\\nIt is also important to note that habilitation services are not covered for individuals under \\n\\nthe age of 21. These services are only available for those 21 and older. Additionally, \\n\\nhabilitation services are not covered for the treatment of mental illness or substance abuse.  \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, it is important to remember that habilitation services can be expensive.

If the emergency services do not meet the criteria, the member may \\n\\nbe responsible for the full cost of the services.  \\n\\nIn addition, Northwind Health Plus may pay for services that are not covered under the \\n\\nplan, if the health care provider determines that such services are medically necessary. The \\n\\nplan will pay for these services at the rates specified in the plan documents.  \\n\\nIt is important to note that all payments are subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, \\n\\nincluding any applicable copayments, coinsurance, and deductible amounts. Members \\n\\nshould always check with their health care provider to determine if a service is covered \\n\\nunder the plan and the amount that will be paid for the service.  \\n\\nIt is also important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not pay for any services that \\n\\nare not medically necessary. Any services that are deemed to be for cosmetic purposes, \\n\\nexperimental treatments, or not medically necessary will not be covered under the plan.  \\n\\nMembers should also keep in mind that the plan may not cover certain services if the \\n\\nmember has not met certain requirements, such as obtaining a referral from a primary care \\n\\nphysician or pre-authorization from Northwind Health Plus.  \\n\\nFinally, Northwind Health Plus may require pre-certification or pre-authorization for \\n\\ncertain services. It is the responsibility of the member to ensure that pre-certification or \\n\\npre-authorization is obtained prior to receiving services. Failure to obtain pre-certification \\n\\nor pre-authorization may result in the member being responsible for the full cost of the \\n\\nservices.  \\n\\nIn summary, Northwind Health Plus provides comprehensive coverage for medical, vision, \\n\\nand dental services, as well as prescription drug coverage, mental health and substance \\n\\nabuse coverage, and coverage for preventive care services.

Additionally, you may have to pay a higher \\n\\ndeductible and coinsurance.  \\n\\nPrescription Drug Costs: Prescription drug costs are also taken into consideration with \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus. Your out-of-pocket costs will depend on the tier of the medication \\n\\nyou are prescribed.

If you are a member in any of these states, you are eligible to receive NEMT \\n\\nservices.  \\n\\nNEMT services are available to members who need to travel to medical appointments as \\n\\nlong as they meet certain criteria. These criteria include:  \\n\\n• The member is unable to arrange for transportation on their own.  \\n\\n• The member is unable to travel to their appointment safely by themselves.  \\n\\n• The member is unable to travel to their appointment by public transportation.  \\n\\n• The appointment is medically necessary and is covered by Northwind Health Plus.  \\n\\nIf you meet these criteria, you may be eligible to receive NEMT services.

You will also need to inform your \\n\\nprovider of the date, time, and location of your appointment, as well as the type of service \\n\\nyou require.  \\n\\nIt’s important to note that NEMT services are not available for all types of medical \\n\\nappointments. This service is only available for medically necessary services that are \\n\\ncovered by Northwind Health Plus. Additionally, NEMT services are only available for \\n\\nappointments within the state you live in.

This will help ensure that your transportation request is processed in \\n\\ntime for your appointment. Additionally, be sure to have your Northwind Health Plus \\n\\nmember ID card with you when you receive transportation services.  \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, it’s important to note that NEMT services are provided by a third-party provider. \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus is not responsible for any fees associated with NEMT services.
